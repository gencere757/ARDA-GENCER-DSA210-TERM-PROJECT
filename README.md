# ARDA-GENCER-DSA210-TERM-PROJECT
This is my term project for DSA210 course, in Fall 2025 term.
# Project Proposal
In this project, I will compare the effect of walkability index, a crucial factor when determining how easy it is for a person to be phsically active in their daily lives, and several health problems that is correlated with sedentary lifestyle, such as obesity and cardiovascular diseases. I will also be utilizing the fast food restaurant count per population as an additional feature since nutrition and access to healthy foods also plays an important role in such diseases.
## Motivation
Ever since I decided living a healthier lifestyle and changing my habits accordingly a few years ago, I became interested about the effects of environmental factors on human health. In the past, I have heard that the place you live can have a huge impact on your health. For example in USA, people usually choose to drive around instead of walking whereas in Europe, people usually walk or bike around and the obesity rates in these regions seems to correlate with how active people are in these regions of the world.
## Plan
My plan is to compare the walkability index data,  that is determined by the characteristics of the environment which would enable a person to choose walking over other modes of travel, and the amount of fast food restaurants per population for each county in US. I will be comparing this data with other datasets such as obesity rate and cardiovascular disease mortality rate and try to find out if there is any link between these features and such diseases.

## The Data That Will Be Used And How To Collect And Use It
The data I will be using will come from data.gov website. The walkability index dataset is a standalone dataset. The version I will be using is actually cleaned and formed into a proper .csv file by another person. The fast food data  will be extracted from the Food Environment Atlas provided by US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service. These comparisons will be made for each county in US. I am then planning to clean and compare the data for each division with each other to be able to determine the level of correlation between them.
